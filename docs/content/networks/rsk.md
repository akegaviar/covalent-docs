# RSK Network

## Introduction

[RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) is the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network.
RSKâ€™s Contracts goal is to add value and functionality to the bitcoin Contracts ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant Contracts payments, and higher scalabiity.
RSK Blockchain is connected to Bitcoin through Merged
Contracts Mining and a two-way peg also known as the bridge.

The RSK blockchain is highly decentralised. RSK is merge-mined with Bitcoin, and has a hashpower that is second only to Bitcoin. As such, it is believed to be the most secure and censorship resistant smart contract platform. Refer to [RSK Stats](https://stats.rsk.co/) for the live value of the RSK hash rate.
