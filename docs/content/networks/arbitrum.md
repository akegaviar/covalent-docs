# Arbitrum Network

## Introduction

[Arbitrum](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart) Arbitrum is an L2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It is a suite of Ethereum scaling solutions that enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts while remaining trustlessly secure.Abitrum possesses the following features: 
- Trustless security: security rooted in Ethereum, with any one party able to ensure correct Layer 2 results
- Compatibility with Ethereum: able to run unmodified EVM contracts and unmodified Ethereum transactions
- Scalability: moving contractsâ€™ computation and storage off of the main Ethereum chain, allowing much higher throughput
- Minimum cost: designed and engineered to minimize the L1 gas footprint of the system, minimizing per-transaction cost.
