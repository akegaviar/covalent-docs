## About Binance

Binance is the world's largest crypto exchange. Binance have launched a pair of blockchains to enable accelerated on-chain crypto trading activity. These chains are known as *Binance Chain* (or "BC") and *Binance Smart Chain* (or "BSC".)


## Binance Smart Chain

**Binance Smart Chain** is an Ethereum-based blockchain network, slightly customized in its consensus mechanism to enable fast finality. Covalent fully supports the [**Binance Smart Chain Mainnet**](/chains/bsc-mainnet) and [**Binance Smart Chain Testnet**](/chains/bsc-testnet) blockchains.


## Binance Chain

**Binance Chain** is a blockchain network that uses a unique [blockchain runtime](/runtimes#what-are-blockchain-runtimes), with no Ethereum API compatibility. We do not yet offer support for Binance Chain.
