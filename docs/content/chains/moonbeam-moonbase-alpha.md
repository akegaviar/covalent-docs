# Moonbeam "Moonbase Alpha" Testnet

## About the Moonbeam Network

[**Moonbeam**](/network-partners/moonbeam) is much more than just an EVM implementation: it’s a highly specialized Layer 1.5 chain that mirrors Ethereum’s Web3 RPC, accounts, keys, subscriptions, logs, and more. The Moonbeam platform extends the base Ethereum feature set with additional features such as on-chain governance, staking, and cross-chain integrations.
