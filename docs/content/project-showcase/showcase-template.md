```

3. You can use number to describe steps/

```

2. Step 2
3. Step 3
```

### Tables

Tables can be used as well and can contain arbitrary Markdown code. As a reference, you can use this online [table generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). To create a table, you can use the following structure:

```

| :---------: | :-------------------------: |
| `ONE`       |  Fetch resource  |
