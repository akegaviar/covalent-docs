convenient for getting tokens info with price in an address https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#get-/v1/{chain_id}/address/{address}/balances_v2/ in JSON format. Covalent API is suppoer convinient when you need bootstrap a project with plenty addresses,
its save lots of effort to query balances of each token, and find related prices
