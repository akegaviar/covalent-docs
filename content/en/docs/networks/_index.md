# Support Networks

## Indexing process

Covalent is a critical infrastructure component of our partner blockchains we support. We work closely with the technical and business teams at these blockchains to ideate, plan and execute a turn-key solution for developers building on top of their blockchains.

To learn more about our indexing process and inquire about having your blockchain indexed to better serve your developers, DM a core team member on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/M4aRubV) channel or email us at: sales@covalenthq.com.
