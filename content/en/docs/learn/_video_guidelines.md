# Tutorial Video Guidelines

To ensure consistency with all our video content, here are a few guidelines to follow:

* A consistent branded video thumbnail. Here is a [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X1gSQp8rweBwl730mhp1d0HA5Uo_xWdm9vHcU58QFcg/edit?usp=sharing)

* The end goal/outcome mentioned in the first min of the video

* Add the covalent logo animation at the end of each video: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1SBDuS22Lg0Rek-90Taen678Eyf-G1vbJ

* Keep tutorial videos short to 5-10 mins and break into multiple parts if necessary.
