# Overview
Welcome! This page provides an overview of Covalent and what makes our API unique. If you have any questions along the way, we have a strong community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/M4aRubV) eager to help. 

&nbsp;
## What is Covalent?
Covalent provides a unified API to bring full transparency and visibility to assets across all blockchain networks. Simply put, we have a single API which allows you to pull detailed, granular blockchain transaction data from multiple blockchains with no code. 

&nbsp;
## What makes Covalent unique?
There are many elements of the Covalent which make us unique in the marketplace. However, our core differentiators from projects like the Graph are:

&nbsp;
### 1. Data availability
We are the only project to fully index entire blockchains â€“ this means every single contract, every single wallet address, and every single transaction. This is billions of rows of data and terabytes of data. Other projects only provide a small subset of the available data or only start collecting data once the appropriate query or filter is set up. 

&nbsp;
### 2. Composability
Composability is a critical piece of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications and allows developers to quickly and easily construct financial solutions leveraging 'Lego-like' building blocks from a multitude of projects. The multichain flexiblity and deep, granular data provided by our APIs means developers can quickly and easily build scalable and data rich applications with no query code.  

&nbsp;
### 3. Multi-blockchain support
Multichain is in our DNA. Covalent already indexes and has customers on 7 different blockchain networks with many more to announce soon. 

&nbsp;
### 4. No code solution
We believe in **no-code** solutions for our users. This means no complicated SQL queries, no subgraph development and maintenance, and no need to invest in highly-skilled (read expensive) developers to simply retrieve blockchain data, which is a monumental waste of engineering time. One API and you are done.
