## What makes Covalent unique? -->

<section class="max-w-5xl">
    <div class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-18 mb-6 pb-3 border-b">
        Data availability
    </div>
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        We are the only project to fully index entire blockchains â€“ this means every single contract, every single wallet address, and every single transaction. This is billions of rows of data and terabytes of data. Other projects only provide a small subset of the available data or only start collecting data once the appropriate query or filter is set up.

        Composability
    </div>
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
        Composability is a critical piece of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications and allows developers to quickly and easily construct financial solutions leveraging 'Lego-like' building blocks from a multitude of projects. The multichain flexiblity and deep, granular data provided by our APIs means developers can quickly and easily build scalable and data rich applications with no query code.

        Multi-blockchain support
    </div>
    <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
       Multichain is in our DNA. Covalent already indexes and has customers on 7 different blockchain networks with many more to announce soon.

    <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 mb-6">
      We believe in 
      <span class="italic">"no-code"</span> 
      solutions for our users. This means no complicated SQL queries, no subgraph development and maintenance, and no need to invest in highly-skilled (read expensive) developers to simply retrieve blockchain data, which is a monumental waste of engineering time. One API and you are done.
